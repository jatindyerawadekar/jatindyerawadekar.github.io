I have started this blog as hopefully, a part of a series where I will try to build a safe, resilient Image Classifier capable of predicting drowsiness with a high f1-score. This is an extension of my undergrad project, where, as part of a team, me and my batchmates were involved in developing a driver drowsiness detection solution on a Pi. Two years on from then, I have finally decided to revive that patchy and barely-held-together code from Github, and try and repurpose it into an actually feasible Deep Learning app. This can be a good learning exercise for me, allowing me to
